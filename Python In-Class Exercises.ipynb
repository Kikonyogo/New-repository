    "> - **Tuple**: Use when you need an ordered sequence of heterogeneous collections whose values need not be changed later in the program.\n",
    "> - **List**: Use when you need an ordered sequence of homogenous collections, whose values can be changed later in the program.\n",
    "> - **Dictionary**: It is ideal for use when you need to relate values with keys, in order to look them up efficiently using a key.\n",
    "> - **Set**: It is ideal for use when you donâ€™t have to store duplicates and you are not concerned about the order or the items. You just want to know whether a particular value already exists or not.\n",
